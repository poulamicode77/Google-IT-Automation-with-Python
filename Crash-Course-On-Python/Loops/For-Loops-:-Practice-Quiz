Question 2
Which option would fix this for loop to print the numbers 12, 18, 24, 30, 36?
for n in range(6,18,3):
  print(n*2)

Ans --> for n in range(6,18+1,3):
  print(n*2)

3.
Question 3
Which for loops will print all even numbers from 0 to 18? Select all that apply.

Ans--> 1) for n in range(19):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        print(n)
2) for n in range(10):
  print(n+n)

4.
Question 4
Fill in the blanks so that the for loop will print the first 10 cube numbers (x**3) in a range that starts with x=1 and ends with x=10.

Ans --> for x in range(1,11):
  print(x**3)

5.
Question 5
Write a for loop with a three parameter range() function that prints the multiples of 7 between 0 and 100. 
Print one multiple per line and avoid printing any numbers that aren't multiples of 7.
Remember that 0 is also a multiple of 7. 

Ans--> for i in range(0, 101, 7):
          print(i)
