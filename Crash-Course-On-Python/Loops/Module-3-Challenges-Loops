Question 1
Fill in the blanks to print the even numbers from 2 to 12.
Ans -->
number = 2 # Initialize the variable 
while number<=12 : # Complete the while loop condition
    print(number, end=" ")
    number = number + 2 # Increment the variable

# Should print 2 4 6 8 10 12 

2.
Question 2
Find and correct the error in the for loop below.  The loop should print every even number from 2 to 12.
Ans -->
for number in range(2, 13, 2):
    print(number)

# Should print:
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
# 10
# 12

3.
Question 3
Fill in the blanks to complete the function “even_numbers(n)”. This function should count how many even numbers exist in a sequence from 0 to the given “n”number, 
where 0 counts as an even number. 
For example, even_numbers(25) should return 13, and even_numbers(6) should return 4.
Ans -->
def even_numbers(n):
    count = 0
    current_number = 0
    while current_number <= n : # Complete the while loop condition
        if current_number % 2 == 0:
            current_number = current_number +2 # Increment the appropriate variable
        count = count +1 # Increment the appropriate variable
    return count
    
print(even_numbers(25))   # Should print 13
print(even_numbers(144))  # Should print 73
print(even_numbers(1000)) # Should print 501
print(even_numbers(0))    # Should print 1

4.
Question 4
Fill in the blanks to complete the “sequence” function. This function should print a sequence of numbers in descending order,
from the given "high" variable to the given "low" variable.  The range should make the loop run two times.
Complete the range sequences in the nested loops so that the “sequence(1, 3)” function call prints the following:
3, 2, 1
3, 2, 1
Ans -->
def sequence(low, high):
    # Complete the outer loop range to make the loop run twice
    # to create two rows
    for x in range(2): 
        # Complete the inner loop range to print the given variable
        # numbers starting from "high" to "low" 
        # Hint: To decrement a range parameter, use negative numbers
        for y in range(high,0,-1): 
            if y == low:
                # Don’t print a comma after the last item
                print(str(y)) 
            else:
                # Print a comma and a space between numbers
                print(str(y), end=", ") 

sequence(1, 3)
# Should print the sequence 3, 2, 1 two times, as shown above.

5.
Question 5
Fill in the blanks to complete the “countdown” function. This function should begin at the “start” variable, which is an integer that is passed to the function,  
and count down to 0. Complete the code so that a function call like “countdown(2)” will return the numbers “2,1,0”.
Ans--> 
def countdown(start):
    x = start
    if x > 0:
        return_string = "Counting down to 0: "
        
        while x>=0: # Complete the while loop
            return_string = return_string + str(x) # Add the numbers to the "return_string"
            if x > 0:
                return_string += ","
            x = x-1 # Decrement the appropriate variable
    else:
        return_string = "Cannot count down to 0"
    return return_string


print(countdown(10)) # Should be "Counting down to 0: 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0"
print(countdown(2)) # Should be "Counting down to 0: 2,1,0"
print(countdown(0)) # Should be "Cannot count down to 0"

6.
Question 6
Fill in the blanks to complete the “even_numbers” function. This function should return a space-separated string of all positive even numbers,
excluding 0, up to and including the “maximum” variable that's passed into the function. 
Complete the for loop so that a function call like “even_numbers(6)” will return the numbers “2 4 6”.
Ans--> 
def even_numbers(maximum):

    return_string = "" # Initializes variable as a string

    # Complete the for loop with a range that includes all even numbers
    # up to and including the "maximum" value, but excluding 0.
    for number in range (1,maximum +1): 

        # Complete the body of the loop by appending the even number
        # followed by a space to the "return_string" variable.
        if number % 2 == 0:
            return_string += str(number) + " "
            
    # This .strip command will remove the final " " space at the end of
    # the "return_string".
    return return_string.strip() 

print(even_numbers(6))  # Should be 2 4 6
print(even_numbers(10)) # Should be 2 4 6 8 10
print(even_numbers(1))  # No numbers displayed
print(even_numbers(3))  # Should be 2
print(even_numbers(0))  # No numbers displayed
